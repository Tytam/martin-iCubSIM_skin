The goal of this part as to group taxels to small groups.
Before our emlation there was only one group for whole forarm. We divided each forarm
into 11 groups.

The code is written in matlab and can be found in matlab_left_forarm directory:
"skinTesselation3D_left_forearm." Everything is 3D point (x,y,z) or 3D line (x,y,z,x2,y2,z2).

The input are two sets of coodinates:
  1. taxel_pos - not acurate experimentaly acuired, 23 plates * 12 taxels, older wersion skin
  2. triangle_centers_CAD - acurate, dimensions of holes for fixing plates to the robot,
                            nearly exact center of the pad, 23 plates * 1 hole
                            
First we identifyed each thermal plate and its taxels in taxel_pos.
We matched 1. set and 2.set.
We translated coordinates of 1. set acording to position of more acurate 2. set (red).

Box is represented by two oposite points (or line) one with minimal value of coordinates and one with maximal.
We tightly fited a box aligned with axes of the forarm around each thermal pad. (upper part "min_max" , lower part "nin_nax")
We seen that motly only 2 (once 3) boxes colide.
We tightly fited coliding boxes into bigger boxes. ("m_m", "n_n") 

This was the base of first prototype integrated in summer 2015.

There wee to many gaps so we decided to cover whole forarm without making any gaps.
